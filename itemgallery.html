          Although modern manufacturers are becoming a little more adventurous,
          the contemporary market has been plagued for several years with banal
          and restrictive speakers designs, guided by a lucrative lifestyle
          market and what brands believe will be seen as acceptable within the
          family home. This effectively translates into tall, thin speaker
          cabinets sporting weedy drive units and no personality. What vintage
          designs will give you, in contrast, is the big, the bold and the
          bizarre. Sound and innovation was the priority back then, not looks or
          interior design, and the sonically adventurous can have a fine time
          investigating older speakers. Dont forget though that the ravages of
          time will hit the speaker in the same way that it will affect any
          piece of hi-fi equipment. While the speaker cabinet is usually fairly
          resilient, keep on eye out for slowly stiffening and crumbling drive
          units and the rubber surrounds, and punctured cones. Also, take a look
          at the connections and make sure that the wiring and soldering has not
          degraded or been disconnected.

          For this list, instead of moving from the lowest cost price to the
          highest, Im going to list the oldest to the newest. Prices will vary,
          of course, depending on a range of factors so the figures I provide
          here are merely a rough guide. I have not supplied a website source
          for each product because sourcing each will require a bit of detective
          work. Id advise eBay, Facebook specialist hi-fi groups, specialist
          hi-fi retailers and small ads in hi-fi magazines and blogs. This is a
          selection of the varied speakers swimming around the market, so please
          add your favourites below in the comments section.
