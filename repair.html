        <h1>Repair</h1>
        <p>
          We have a knowledgeable and professional staff with more than 25 years
          of experience repairing and replacing home and pro audio speakers. We
          are factory authorized to repair many major brands of speakers and
          also offer our custom audio brands FH Audio (home audio) and V.O.R.
          (guitar speakers). Check them out, great speakers at great prices. For
          the first 2 years, we were located in St Paul on Snelling Ave and
          I-94, but we moved to Roseville in 2017. We have expanded our repair
          shop and added a retail store that sells new and used home audio and
          pro audio gear.
