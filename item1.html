      Reviews:
      For a small room, say 10x12, the 4 series are more than adequate, the larger models definitely adequate. The 9's sure, but overkill.
My cave is not large, and I'm running a set of ADS 910's, and they sound great! Overkill, certainly, but it doesn't mean you have to crank them. In fact, large speakers in smaller listening spaces can be quite amazing at low to moderate volumes and give you a totally immersive experience where smaller speakers cannot.
I also listen to my JBL 4301bs in the same space, and they also sound great.
So big or small, you'll get excellent sound, it's just what you can find, afford and fit.
